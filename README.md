# Binance - Crypro giant's being and becoming

## Overview and Origin

Changpeng Zhao, a developer who previously designed high-frequency trading software, started Binance in 2017. Before creating Binance, CZ worked at Okex, which is also a top crypto exchange. And it was from Okex, CZ met He Yi, co-founder of Binance and the most important female in his life. He Yi is the person who encouraged CZ to invest in the crypto field in the early stages, and also, his wife.

Back in 2017, ICO was the theme of the whole bull run. Binance was also successfully launched through a 15 million ICO, and $BNB was issued at around $1 during ICO. $BNB is still one of the most rewarded tokens with more than 200x returns within 4 years, relying on Binance's crazily high-profit business mode.

In 2018, Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm, sued Binancefor allegedly breaching an exclusivity agreement. When Binance launched in August 2017, Zhao was negotiating terms with Sequoia Capital regarding an investment. Sequoia invested slightly more than $8 million in Binance for an 11% interest in talks that valued the cryptocurrency at $80 million at the time. Zhao's team advised Sequoia that Binance's shareholders considered the suggested $80 million to be an undervaluation. As the deal failed to materialize, Zhao of Binance received a separate offer from another venture capital firm, IDG Capital. The terms of the much higher valuation included two planned rounds of fundraising of $400 million and $1 billion, respectively.

Through the growth of Binance, it has never been absent from headlines.
